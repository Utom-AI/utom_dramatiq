 'project_details': {'project_title': 'Utom Screen Ecosystem',
  'project_description': 'Utom Screen is a comprehensive screen recording and sharing tool fully integrated into the Utom ecosystem. It is designed to help teams reduce unnecessary meetings and emails by enabling users to capture, save, and review screen recordings. The tool leverages the power of SUI Walrus for reliable storage and bunnyCDN for smooth playback, while a dedicated Dramatiq-powered backend processes recordings to generate valuable metadata such as transcripts and action plans. This integration not only enhances communication but also improves planning and task management by allowing users to attach recordings to tasks, projects, or features. The result is a streamlined workflow that enhances productivity and collaboration across the organization.',

   {'role': 'assistant',
    'content': 'Thanks for sharing those technical details. Here\'s a quick summary of what we\'ve defined so far:• Project: Utom Screen, an Agent app functioning similarly to Loom.  • Purpose & Problem Statement: To help teams avoid unnecessary meetings and emails by communicating and sharing updates via screen recordings.  • Target Audience: All Utom users.  • Business Goals: Reduce the time users spend in meetings and enhance planning by referencing previous screen recordings.  • Market Positioning: Unlike standalone apps, Utom Screen will be integrated into the broader Utom ecosystem, leveraging its existing features and connections.  • High-Level Technical Requirements: Ability to record screens, attach recordings to tasks/projects/features, capture and display metadata (such as transcripts and action plans), and enable replay functionality.Now that we\'ve wrapped up the project vision and scope, let\'s transition to Phase 2 – Feature Exploration and Dependencies.To start on this phase, could you outline what you consider the core functionality requirements or "must-have" features for Utom Screen?'},
   {'role': 'user',
    'content': 'Core functionality would be- I can click on an app on utom that would open the screen app- I can see all my previous screens as well as create a new screen- screens will be saved to SUI walrus and I can easily retrive them and download- screens will be played via bunnyCDN'},
   {'role': 'assistant',
    'content': "Let's dive into some dependencies and relationships between these features. For instance, how do you envision the interaction between recording a screen, saving metadata, and attaching it to tasks/projects? Are there any technical dependencies or integrations (like with SUI Walrus or bunnyCDN) that we should be aware of which might affect the order or manner in which these features are implemented?"},
   {'role': 'user',
    'content': "Not necessarily but we will need to build the functionality for managing the screens, as well asbuild backend functionality (i'm thinking a dramatiq app), that create tasksonce a screen is done to download and analyse it and generate relevant metadata"},
   {'role': 'assistant',
    'content': 'Thanks for clarifying that. Now, shifting a bit towards feature prioritization using the MoSCoW method: which of these functionalities do you consider as must-have for your minimum viable product? For example, would you prioritize screen recording, managing and storing screens, or the backend process for generating metadata as "must-have" features?'},
   {'role': 'user',
    'content': 'I would say all of them are must have features, think wholistically about the end to end functionality needed to make a product like this come to life'},
   {'role': 'assistant',
    'content': "Thanks for confirming that all these functionalities are must-have to ensure a complete end-to-end solution. Before we move to a final summary, let's discuss the acceptance criteria for Utom Screen. Could you share some acceptance criteria for the overall product? For example, what conditions should be met from the user's perspective (like performance, ease-of-use, and seamless integration) and any technical reliability benchmarks (such as download speed from SUI Walrus or playback smoothness from bunnyCDN) to consider the product ready for launch?"},
   {'role': 'user',
    'content': 'Main acceptance criteria:- i can click on the app and it opens- I can see all my previous screens as well as create a new screen- screens will be saved to SUI walrus and I can easily retrive them and download- screens will be played via bunnyCDN'},
   {'role': 'assistant',
    'content': "Here's a comprehensive summary of our project definition for Utom Screen:• Purpose & Problem Statement:\u2003– Utom Screen is an Agent app—similar in concept to Loom—that helps teams avoid unnecessary meetings and emails by communicating updates and sharing ideas through screen recordings. The additional layer of metadata (transcripts and action plans) provides context for future work and planning.• Target Audience:\u2003– All Utom users.• Business Goals:\u2003– Reduce the overall time users spend in meetings.\u2003– Enhance planning and guidance by referring back to previous screen recordings.• Market Positioning:\u2003– Unlike standalone apps, Utom Screen will be tightly integrated into the Utom ecosystem, leveraging existing features and ensuring seamless interaction across the platform.• High-Level Technical Requirements:\u2003– Ability to record the screen.\u2003– Option to attach recordings to tasks, projects, and features.\u2003– Store recordings (screens) using SUI Walrus with easy retrieval and download capabilities.\u2003– Play recordings via bunnyCDN.\u2003– Backend support (e.g., a Dramatiq app) to manage post-recording tasks such as download, analysis, and metadata generation.• Core Functionality (Must-Have Features):\u20031. Entry Point & Navigation: \u2003\u2003– Users can click on Utom to open the screen app.\u20032. Screen Management: \u2003\u2003– A user-friendly interface that shows all previous screens alongside options to create new screens.\u20033. Storage & Retrieval:\u2003\u2003– Efficient saving of screens to SUI Walrus with straightforward retrieval and download processes.\u20034. Playback:\u2003\u2003– Smooth playback of screens via bunnyCDN.\u20035. Backend Processing:\u2003\u2003– A dedicated backend component (e.g., using Dramatiq) that kicks into action once a screen is recorded. This includes downloadable processing and the analysis required to generate relevant metadata (transcripts and action plans).• Feature Dependencies and Relationships:\u2003– The user first engages with the app (entry point), develops a screen recording, and then the system ensures that recordings are stored and can be retrieved from SUI Walrus.\u2003– Once the recording is complete, the backend automatically processes and analyzes the recording to tag metadata and possibly create tasks based on the analysis.\u2003– Playback is enabled through bunnyCDN, ensuring smooth user experience when rewatching recordings.\u2003– All these components must work seamlessly within the Utom ecosystem.• Acceptance Criteria:\u2003– I can click on the Utom Screen app from within the Utom ecosystem, and it successfully opens.\u2003– I can view all my previous screen recordings and have a robust interface to create new recordings.\u2003– Once a screen is recorded, it will be saved to SUI Walrus, and I can easily retrieve and download it.\u2003– I can replay any screen recording, with playback delivered via bunnyCDN ensuring smooth performance.\u2003– The backend automatically processes recordings after their completion to generate necessary metadata (transcripts, action plans, task creation, etc.).This summary ties together both the front-end and back-end aspects, market differentiation, and clear acceptance criteria to ensure a complete end-to-end functionality for Utom Screen. Does this comprehensive review meet your expectations for the project, or is there anything additional you'd like to adjust or expand upon?"}]},
