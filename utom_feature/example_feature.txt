We\u2019re building Utom Meet, a meeting app in the Utom ecosystem that enhances productivity and accountability by capturing meeting transcripts and action items post-meeting, with an integrated calendar view for meetings.2. The UX is designed to be simple and intuitive\u2014a crucial factor for our target startups and organization-wide adoption\u2014with a smooth onboarding process.3. The meeting creation flow involves an LLM-driven conversation with roughly five turn-by-turn questions. Users can attach context (like features, docs, tasks, or projects) and then specify meeting details and attendees. Finally, meeting invites are sent as tasks in the Utom ToDo app, prompting invitees to acknowledge via acceptance or rejection.4. After creating a meeting, users are directed back to the Utom Meet homepage, where they can manage and search their meetings. Invitees get reminders for pending tasks.5. For joining meetings, users can only join if the meeting is scheduled to start within 15 minutes. If a user tries to join too early, they receive a message that the meeting hasn\u2019t started. For overrun meetings, a notification is displayed\u2014for up to 30 minutes over\u2014after which the meeting is cut off.6. Productivity tracking is built in by capturing join and leave timestamps for each team member as they participate, translating meeting attendance into task completions for productivity metrics.7. While no specific performance expectations or additional edge cases were identified at this stage, there's room to iterate on these aspects in future releases.Before we close out, is there anything else you'd like to add or explore further at this point?"
